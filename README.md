# Strategic-Cyber-Defence:Analysis of Modern Cyber Warfare Tactics National Security Protections.

The study provides a rigorous examination of modern cyber warfare operations, national defense strategies, and introduces the Multi-Layered Strategic Defense Model (MLSDM) as a blueprint for strengthening national cyber resilience.

# Overview
Modern cyber warfare has transformed global security. State and non-state actors now employ sophisticated, multi-vector attacks—ranging from supply-chain intrusions to AI-enabled operations—that challenge traditional national defense models.

This research provides:
	•	A taxonomy of modern cyber warfare tactics based on analysis of 2,847 incidents (2015–2024)
	•	A comparative evaluation of 12 national cybersecurity strategies
	•	Detailed case studies of major cyber incidents (SolarWinds, NotPetya, Colonial Pipeline, etc.)
	•	A new strategic framework: Multi-Layered Strategic Defense Model (MLSDM)
	•	A national security alignment model with KPIs for improved cyber-resilience

# Why This Project Is Useful
This repository helps:
	•	Researchers: Gain structured insights into evolving cyber warfare methods.
	•	Cybersecurity professionals: Understand defense gaps and recommended architectures.
	•	Policymakers: Assess national cyber posture and implement evidence-based improvements.
	•	Students: Study detailed methodologies, case analysis, and real-world applications.

The paper proposes actionable frameworks that nations can adopt to improve detection, response, deterrence, and resilience against sophisticated adversaries.
